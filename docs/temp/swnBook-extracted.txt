One-Roll Patrons
PCs often need patrons to aim them at adventures or
offer suitable recompense for semi-legal favors. In con-    d4           Patron Eagerness to Hire
junction with the adjacent one-roll NPC tables, you can      1    Cautious, but can be convinced to hire
use the tools below to quickly generate a patron and        2     Willing to promise standard rates
what it is they want from the party.
     One particularly convenient technique is to have       3     Eager, willing to offer a bonus
a few short filler adventures drawn up as described on      4     Desperate, might offer what they can’t pay
page 177, and then when the players suddenly need
a job or need a favor that only a cooperative patron

could provide, use the patron to hook them up with
the filler adventure. If you lack a convenient premade       1    Government official favors owed
adventure, it’s usually most practical to have the patron    2    Property in the area
request some simple, direct, one-scene job that you feel    3     An item very valuable on another world
comfortable in running on the fly. You can consult page
178 to find appropriate pay rates for different patrons.    4     Pretech mod components

    1    They intend to totally screw the PCs               7     Membership in a powerful group
   2     They won’t pay unless forced to do so               8    Black market access
   3     They’ll pay slowly or reluctantly                  9     Use of restricted facilities or shipyards
   4     They’ll pay, but discount for mistakes             10    Shares in a profitable business
   5     They’ll pay without quibbling                       11   Maps to a hidden or guarded treasure
   6     They’ll pay more than they promised                12    Illegal but valuable weapons or gear


   d8             Basic Challenge of the Job                d20             Complication to the Job
    1     Kill somebody who might deserve it                 1    An ambush is laid somewhere
   2      Kidnap someone dangerous                           2    PC involvement is leaked to the enemy
   3      Steal a well-guarded object                       3     The patron gives faulty aid somehow
   4     Arson or sabotage on a place                       4     Failing would be extremely unhealthy
   5      Get proof of some misdeed                          5    The job IDs them as allies of a local faction
   6      Protect someone from an immediate threat           6    The macguffin is physically dangerous
   7     Transport someone through danger                   7     An important location is hard to get into
   8      Guard an object being transported                 8     Succeeding would be morally distasteful
                                                            9     A supposed ally is very unhelpful or stupid
  d10             Main Countervailing Force                 10    The patron badly misunderstood the PCs
    1    A treacherous employer or subordinate               11   The job changes suddenly partway through
   2     An open and known enemy of the patron              12    An unexpected troublemaker is involved
   3      Official governmental meddling                    13    Critical gear will fail partway through
   4     An unknown rival of the patron                     14    An unrelated accident complicates things
   5     The macguffin itself opposes them                  15    Payment comes in a hard-to-handle form
   6     Very short time frame allowed                      16    Someone is turning traitor on the patron
   7     The job is spectacularly illegal                   17    A critical element has suddenly moved
   8     A participant would profit by their failure        18    Payment is in avidly-pursued hot goods
   9     The patron is badly wrong about a thing            19    The true goal is a subsidiary part of the job
   10    The locals are against the patron                  20    No complications; it’s just as it seems to be

One-Roll Urban Encounters
There are inevitably times when a GM needs some-
thing to distract the PCs quickly. A quick encounter,         d4         What’s the Conflict About?
whether in the urban jungles or the alien wastes, can          1    Money, extortion, payment due, debts
buy a GM the time they need to puzzle out some larger          2    Respect, submission to social authority
problem. The tables here can be used to create a simple
urban event to occupy the PCs for a little while.             3     Grudges, ethnic resentment, gang payback
     The exact details of the event will have to be sup-      4     Politics, religion, or other ideology

culture and situation, but the goal of the tables is to

One-Roll Wilderness Encounters
Building appropriate wilderness encounters will vary
greatly with the planet in question, but the tables below   d4              Initial Encounter Range

replace the features with alien relics or the remnants      3     Noticed only within 1d6 x 10 meters
of scouts or lost colonies.                                 4     Noticed only when adjacent to the event

lines will vary depending on the choices and capabilities
of the PCs. Some encounters are unlikely to occur at         1    Bandits in their wilderness hideout
